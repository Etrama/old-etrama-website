    My current magnum opus. Consecutively scraped a ton of images for the top 100 anime followed by scraping even more than a ton of images of the top 10 characters in each anime. The goal was to try to identify anime using a ML model and when successful, we planned to identify the characters in the image as well. WIP.

    My notes on a few Deep Learning papers. Hopefully, I improve my understanding of Deep Learning in the process (also helps when I want to revisit the paper) while making it easier for other people to read papers.
